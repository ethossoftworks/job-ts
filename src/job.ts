/**
 * A cancellable unit of work with optional cancellation hierarchy.
 *
 * Cancellation is cooperative, meaning the user has to define pause/suspension points in the task via the [pause] or
 * [ensureActive] methods or by checking [isActive].
 *
 * Cancelling a parent Job will cancel all children Jobs launched with the job defined as its parent. All children must
 * also cooperatively check for cancellation.
 *
 * A parent job will not wait for any children jobs unless explicitly awaited on in the provided [JobFunc]. In this
 * instance, if the parent completes before its child has completed, the parent will be marked as completed and the
 * children will be cancelled at the next pause point.
 *
 * If an exception is thrown during a JobFunc, the job will cancel itself and its children and then rethrow the
 * exception to be handled by the user.
 *
 * Running a job more than once will result in a [JobCancellationException].
 *
 * Note: When adding a try/catch mechanism inside of a [JobFunc], make sure to rethrow any [JobCancellationException]
 * exceptions, otherwise job cancellation will not work as intended.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```
 const job = Job(async (job) => {
 *     // This creates a pause point. If the job is cancelled while this operation is running,
 *     // the job will immediately return [Error] with a [JobCancellationException] as its result.
 *     const result = await job.pause(someLongRunningTask());
 *
 *     if (result.error != null) {
 *         return Outcome.error("Problem");
 *     }
 *     return Outcome.ok("All good!");
 * });
 *
 * const jobResult = await job.run();
 * ```
